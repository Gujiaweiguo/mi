## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The system SHALL establish automated test foundations before feature slices
The change SHALL provide backend unit and integration test harnesses, frontend unit tests, Playwright end-to-end tests, and artifact comparison support for generated outputs before feature slices depend on them. End-to-end verification for first-release non-membership scope SHALL be reproducible under documented clean-checkout bootstrap assumptions so archive-evidence generation remains trustworthy. Unit and integration evidence emitted by the verification scripts SHALL derive reported test counts from actual test results rather than fixed placeholder values.

#### Scenario: Unit evidence reports real aggregated counts
- **WHEN** the unit verification workflow runs backend unit tests and frontend unit tests for a commit
- **THEN** the resulting `unit` evidence SHALL report `total`, `passed`, `failed`, and `skipped` counts derived from the actual executed test results across the covered unit suites

#### Scenario: Integration evidence reports real command results
- **WHEN** the integration verification workflow runs the integration-tagged backend tests for a commit
- **THEN** the resulting `integration` evidence SHALL report `total`, `passed`, `failed`, and `skipped` counts derived from the actual executed integration test results
